<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>The Massachusetts Partnership for Transition to Employment (MPTE) is a systems-change project of the Massachusetts
Department of Developmental Services. The project is designed to improve employment outcomes for individuals with
intellectual and developmental disabilities transitioning from school to adult life.</p>

<p>MPTE is funded through September 2021 by a 5-year federal grant from the Administration on Intellectual and
Developmental Disabilities.</p>

<p>The broad-based MPTE Consortium guides and supports the goals and objectives of MPTE across MPTEâ€™s 4 focus areas, which
research has shown are critical to the transition process:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/pages/mpte_ccc.html"><strong>Cross Systems Collaboration</strong></a>. Cross-agency, cross-program, and
cross-disciplinary collaborative efforts using a tiered approach at the state, local, and individual level.</li>
  <li><a href="/pages/mpte_we.html"><strong>Work Experiences</strong></a>. Youth and young adults with intellectual and developmental
disabilities having work experiences and paid employment in integrated settings similar to their peers without
disabilities, and within these efforts, building capacity for access to postsecondary education and training that
positively impacts employment outcomes.</li>
  <li><a href="/pages/mpte_fe.html"><strong>Family Engagement</strong></a>. Consistent family engagement in supporting competitive
integrated employment.</li>
  <li><a href="/pages/mpte_sdsa.html"><strong>Self-Determination and Self-Advocacy</strong></a>. Systematic development of
self-determination and self-advocacy skills for youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities, with a focus on
employment.</li>
</ol>

<p>Through its activities, MPTE is identifying best practices in each of these areas, and how they can be fully
implemented, integrated, and sustained within Massachusetts. The project is advancing these best practices through
development of policy and guidance documents, development and dissemination of materials for a wide range of
stakeholders, and training and technical assistance.</p>

<p>Leadership for the MPTE is provided by a steering committee, which includes representatives from the following
organizations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Department of Developmental Services</li>
  <li>Massachusetts Developmental Disabilities Council</li>
  <li>Department of Elementary and Secondary Education</li>
  <li>Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission</li>
  <li>Department of Labor and Workforce Development</li>
  <li>Institute for Community Inclusion at UMass Boston</li>
  <li>The Arc of Massachusetts</li>
  <li>Massachusetts Advocates Standing Strong</li>
</ul>
