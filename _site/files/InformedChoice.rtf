  So again, past experience said okay.  That is that.  I don't know if anybody else wants to verbally share, but I think the point is fairly obvious that we all [indiscernible by captioner] our experiences, we make decisions in  life based on our experien

es and what has happened in the past and what interests us.  I can tell you myself personally I started out in this world planning to work in a hotel as a hospitality manager.  That was my goal at the age of 16, 17, 18, 21.  I'm hardly doing that today.  
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 S\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

And we certainly have a different generation now.  But I think we also have to realize that the way that many people with disabilities have been treated in their society has created real challenges in terms of really making choices and decisions.  As 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
we move on, we also need to recognize that choices are not just an A and B choice.  I think there's also this challenge [indiscernible by captioner] that is not like I choose list A or list B.  Because I think there's so much this idea of when they hear t
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
e term choice often, frankly, misused in our field.  We gave them a choice.  We said you want to work at McDonald's or do you want to work at Target?  Well, that's an A and B choice.  Or do you want to -- do you want to work or not work?  Which is really 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ot well defined.  So we have to recognize that the choices that we all make are not just A and B, list A and list B, and really our choices need to be informed and we need to have control.  Lara, can you mute somebody?  What makes a choice an informed cho
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 i\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ce?  We already talked about some of this already.  It is experience.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid3482102

Certainly it helps in terms of that, in terms of -- it's part of a guides informed choice.  Experience, information, all of those things that allow us, even though sometimes we are maki\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
a pretty good one.  It is the process of choosing from options, so you have a variety of things you're choosing from, based on accurate information.  So the information must be accurate.  It's not just any information but the information is accurate.  So

And as I said already the reality of [indiscernible by captioner] my own experience doing direct support I was actually first started in this field in 1991 and the thing that I was -- and I work with a lot of folks comi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

 base decisions on because they had only grown up in very institutional type environments.  They had limited opportunities to explore life and do things.  The second thing that I was struck by was they always deferred to staff.  The staff will let me do t
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

mbraces employment.  What I mean that is a culture programmatically.  So you all work for school or programs or service providers and it is really important that within that that informed choice is embraced.  And similarly we will talk about families and

aid already, we are working with folks oftentimes who can be at risk in the community.  That we need to be thoughtful.  And I think we actually, in my own personal view, I think we need to raise our tolerance for risk at times.  We don't want to put peopl

 think about decision-making, as we think about decisions that people with disability is make in their lives, that we all make in our lives, this is a fairly complex effort.  And we need to recognize the complexities and the variables within this.  So we

eed to recognize that we are talking about first off we talked about experience.  Yes, that's a big part of decision-making.  And one of the first things I learned with I got my Masters in social work is we need to recognize that we all are sums of our ex

erience.  And that we need to recognize that everybody, we cannot be saying everybody does everything from our perspective, we need to try to see things from the other persons perspective as best as we can because their experience is not your experience a

So we often are trying to please or frankly in some cases we sort of have to abide by what they want.  So that is certainly going to influence the choices that we make.  And the other things are social expectat\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ions.  There are certain things that are social expectable and so much things that are not so much so.  What I love about 2020 compared to when I grew up that you can, I think in many ways, that there is the social expectations are much more diverse in so
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 many ways.  Relationships is, obviously, one.  Sexual identity, all of those things but just in terms of how people can look.  I grew up in the 1960s\'16

hair and things like that.  You see people with short hair, long hair, tattoos, piercings, and frankly I think that is cool.  If that works for you.  But I think when people get really out there with some of that stuff we have to realize that there's goin

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 c\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
reates some challenges and some dilemmas.  And certainly, peers.  They are highly influential.  What do your peers think?  What do they expect?  We can tell you as a former teenage boy peers can have all sorts of influence and not always in a good way.  E
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 v\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
en as an adult sometimes.  But peers do have an enormous influence and we are very much into pleasing our peers and making them happy and we want friends.  So we've just got to recognize as we work people through this idea of informed choice there is a lo

t calendar of activities.  Rather than starting with the individual and what they want and what interests them.  We've got these calendar of activities, choose one, two, or three.  To me, that is uninformed choice.  Another example is saying to people do 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 y\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ou want to spend your day -- in the old days [indiscernible by captioner] or be on the enclave in the community doing cleaning?  Again, that is just two choices.  You are basically really limiting people what they can do and the possibility of choices and
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
things like that.  So we've just got to be careful that as programs and services -- and I've seen this in schools.  And again, if some of you are doing this I don't mean to beat you up but I think you need to recognize.  I've seen transition programs whic
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 o\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
f teenagers -- as food, retail, places like that but we certainly expand beyond that fairly quickly.  We've got to be careful that we are not to just doing uninformed choices or just limited options based on staff and based on what the program wants.  Com

ents or questions on that?  I think this is the one I get a lot and this is where I get frustrated.  I always hear this, we ask them if they want to work in the community and they said no.  So that is that.  We just asked them, do you want to work in the 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 c\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ommunity, they said no, and that is not an informed choice.  I cannot tell you the number of times I have seen this and had discussions with programs and families and individuals.  All of these people I don't want to work in the community.  What is your d

onsequences to choices we make.  We need to understand those consequences and part of helping people through choices is saying there are consequences to the choices you are making.  Whether it's a choice you make not to work or work or this kind of job or
,\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 frankly, I want to work these hours and not work these hours.  Whatever it might be.  So that is really important.  And to recognize that we can't just do whatever we want.  Nor can people with disabilities can't and certainly we cannot.  So it is no dif

erent.  And this is also where I've gotten into these ridiculous debates with people about things like choice about we can't just allow people to do whatever they want.  We're not talking about letting them do whatever they want.  Allowing them to do, hav
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 the same rights to choice as everyone else.  That is what it is about.  And there are a ton of factors that go into limiting our choices but, again, as I said from the beginning, people with disabilities their choices have been much more limited than the

 not dismiss that dream but let's also look at other options that may fulfill his interest in radio and we don't dismiss that dream out of hand.  But there's also a reality in terms of limitations about what might be available.  So it's not denying his ch

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 m\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e of this, hopefully, is obvious.  It's the right thing for people.  People have the right to self-determination, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid4347419\charrsid3482102

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
we will talk about in a few minutes that will be taken to ensure that people have an informed choice.  People have a right to informed choice.  Under the workforce innovation opportunity act for many years the rehabilitation act has spoken about folks hav
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 a right to informed choice.  And also, under Section 511 which are varied limitations on minimum wage which I want to get into details there are a lot of discussion about people have an informed choice about working in the community.  So it's regarded by
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
the workplace innovation but specifically the rehabilitation expert also come the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services which is a lot of geeky stuff but that is what funds a lot of what DDS does as well as services with people with disabilities.  And

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
employment are these.  Entities actually came from the U.S. Department of Justice guidance but they are also best practice.  We will do a deep dive into all five of these in if humans.  Number one, people should be provided information about the benefits 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 o\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
f working in an integrated setting.  It starts with providing information.  But information is not enough.  We also should be facilitating visits or their expenses of integrated settings.  So we should be going out and trying things in the community.  Num
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 b\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
er 3, peer-to-peer discussions.  That individuals and families should have opportunities to talk to each other and talk about employment.  And talk about their experiences.  Number 4, if there are issues that are identified, challenges, objections, those 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
hould be identified.  And those should be addressed any way possible.  You may not address them that day but they should be addressed over time and then this is that not a one and done thing.  If someone says I don't want to work right now.  I don't want

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
to share?  And what information to side?  We will talk about the benefits of working.  I will give folks a second to type.  And maybe just to get the conversation going a little bit, and obvious one is that if you work that your money, you have more choic

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  necessarily something that we do separately from everything else.  It's not like today is our informed choice conversation about employment.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
k about what type of experiences there might be.  How do we ensure quality experiences or that the experiences are of quality and are sufficient.  And also, we need to help individuals process what they learn.  And Denise, you noted about volunteering.  W
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
at other ways can we help people get experience in the community?  Other thoughts about this?  Forgetting experience?  Think about job exploration and how do we get people exposed to community settings?  Thoughts on that?  Job tours, that is a big one.  A
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d I know to hear about the importance of lots of different experiences.  Again, we don't have three places that we have people tour.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ell you one thing sometimes you have to do is getting people out trying different things, touring different businesses, because if they don't have a sense of what they want to do.  And again, we have seen all this, probably, everybody wants to work at McD

nald's or Burger King for this is the one place that they go that makes them happy.  Maybe start with that but let's get beyond that.  Let's make sure we are exposing people to lots of different work environments.  Obviously, based on their interest and d

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
talk to them about what did they learn?  Briana noted one step we often skip or don't take into account is introducing folks to a career path trajectory versus what you want to do.  The vast majority of people need to work to build skills.  Often in nonpr
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ferred jobs as they work towards more of a group work I think that is a good point, Briana.  Two points there.  A lot of us took our jobs because we knew somebody or we through an application and at the local store or whatever.  Just to get expanse.  And 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 I\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 think that is an important point that we have to cancel people on your first job is not your last job.  We all have to gain experience and we learn so much just by being into a work setting.  Again, people have the right to choose where they were.  They 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hould be making those decisions.  We shouldn't be making them on the behalf but also counseling them that this is just a start.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid4347419

].  Just because I started working at a retail store that we also are going back and think maybe this is not what you want to do for life but this as at least a starting point and let's go back and think of this as a career journey.  And it's a whole othe

We have a great new website.  One thing I would like to say is identifying individuals and piers coming out to identify the expenses.  I think it's important to see who is available to talk to people who have not reject.  For example, if you are a

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 lking about how they had to overcome some of those.  Talking about how it was a process to get where they were.  It's really important to share that.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

velopment task with specialists and when a purchase make is a job we had to them come back and share their success stories.  Have them come back and share and how it's going.  And I think also, again, fortunately in this age visuals can be really powerful
.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
  So people can share pictures of them at the job, videos of them at the job, things like that can be powerful as well.  I can talk all day, you've probably figured that out over the last there.  But me as a professional talking is not going to be nearly 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
s powerful as a per talking to a peer and family talking to families because we will talk about them since he a second and families can be sometimes really challenging.  Somebody already noted that.  In terms of this topic that can be our greatest support
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
rs.  But when family talks we know the family that can open up Isaac and see ways that we cannot necessarily do.  So again, think about this.  And it can't just be a one-time thing but think about it.  Are you having group events were people -- peers can 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 c\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ome and talk.  And they come in for one to one discussions?  Think about things like you've got a family that you're struggling with in terms of support for their family member in terms of employment.  See if you can find somebody to set up a time that th

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
of that is okay.  We all evolve.  Your friends will still be here.  Let's figure out ways you can still have these relationships but you will meet new friends in the community.  And I think that this is sometimes using the analogy of we all move on in cer

This is their loved one.  This is someone they care for.  And they have a role to play.  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid4347419

So as you are doing with families as you are moving along to keep them informed about each step as you are moving forward on employment and expiration process.  As con\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
cerns come up make sure to respond to them in a respectful way.  Again, we need peer to peer efforts can be helpful.  And just remind them it is about exploring options.  We are just export options.  Your loved one, sister, brother, child is not going to

 them?  I think this can be -- it is a tricky process, it is not always easy and I think we just have to be thoughtful and do our best to develop strong relationships with families where they trust us.  Now again, I'm obscene talking about him as that may
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
be challenged and we also have other families that are wonderful that are really supportive and want their family member to work.  Angela supportive of it.  But it can be, as we know, a mixed bag so we had to be thoughtful in how we approach family spirit

Yes, they have legal authority, absolutely, and some legal decision-making, but they are to support the person as best they can and with due respect there are some wonderful guardians out there.  But there are others that misread their role and don't r
