          <p>
            When employment services incorporate self-management strategies into
            their supports, job seekers get access to more hours, higher paying
            jobs, and they tend to learn skills that are transferable to other
            situations. This 4-week module on self-management strategies focuses
            on tools that a person can use independently, sometime
            interdependently, to keep themselves on track. In this module, we
            will focus on a range of self-management solutions so that you can
            access tools that will work for anyone and everyone you support.
