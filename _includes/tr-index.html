When employment services incorporate self-management strategies into their supports, job seekers get access to more hours, higher paying jobs, and they tend to learn skills that are transferable to other situations. This 4-week module on self-management strategies focuses on tools that a person can use independently, sometime interdependently, to keep themselves on track. In this module, we will focus on a range of self-management solutions so that you can access tools that will work for anyone and everyone you support.
