            Informed Choice: It’s More Than Just Asking
          </a> </h5>
        <p>“Informed choice” is a term that is used a lot in terms of employment services and supports for people with
          disabilities. But what does it really mean? Attendees at this webinar will learn about strategies that will
          ensure that individual’s choices in terms of employment are truly “informed”. We will focus in particular on
          individuals with significant disabilities with limited experience in both employment and choice making, and
          who may be in the habit of deferring to the wishes of others. A variety of strategies for maximizing informed
          choice will be discussed, emphasizing experiential activities that inform an individual about the range of
          employment choices available, use of peer-to-peer supports, and how to address barriers to employment. </p>
