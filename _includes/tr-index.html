Providing Employment Services in the Current Environment 

</a> </h5>
        <p>Even during these difficult times, we are committed to assisting individuals to reach their employment goals.  How we help them do this has changed significantly over the last few months.  From facilitating career planning and exploration to interviews and job supports- we are having to shift how we provide these services but still provide all the supports that individuals need to be successful.  Participants in this webinar will learn best practices in providing remote services, keeping teams engaged and supporting employers and individuals as they start new jobs or return to work after a leave.</p>

Providing CBDS Services in the Current Environment 
</a> </h5>
        <p>The current pandemic has created major challenges to a core tenet of Community Based Day Supports (CBDS): spending maximum time in the community and physically interacting with other community members. However, CBDS can still be provided, with individuals participating in their communities, interacting with other community members, and working on goal directed skill development. Participants in this webinar will learn about a variety of strategies for providing CBDS services during this time, and how the current environment can serve as a catalyst for long-term enhancements for CBDS.</p>

Informed Choice: It’s More Than Just Asking 
</a> </h5>
        <p>“Informed choice” is a term that is used a lot in terms of employment services and supports for people with disabilities. But what does it really mean? Attendees at this webinar will learn about strategies that will ensure that individual’s choices in terms of employment are truly “informed”. We will focus in particular on individuals with significant disabilities with limited experience in both employment and choice making, and who may be in the habit of deferring to the wishes of others. A variety of strategies for maximizing informed choice will be discussed, emphasizing experiential activities that inform an individual about the range of employment choices available, use of peer-to-peer supports, and how to address barriers to employment. </p>
