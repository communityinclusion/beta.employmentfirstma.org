          <h4>Module 3: Self-Management: Tools and Strategies to Build and Inspire Independence
          </h4>
          <p><em>Registration will open early May</em> </p>
          <p>

            When employment services incorporate self-management strategies into their supports, job seekers get access
            to more hours, higher paying jobs, and they tend to learn skills that are transferable to other situations.
            This 4-week module on self-management strategies focuses on tools that a person can use independently,
            sometime interdependently, to keep themselves on track. In this module, we will focus on a range of
            self-management solutions so that you can access tools that will work for anyone and everyone you support.
