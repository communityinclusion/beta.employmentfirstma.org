        <p>Close your eyes and picture your view of the community. Do you see walls? We donâ€™t either. In this session we will immerse participants in the best practice in Community-Based Day Supports design, complemented by a journey into an innovative Without Walls program built upon these best practices. You will experience services designed and delivered free of walls and full of opportunity.</p>
